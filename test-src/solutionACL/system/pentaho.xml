		The configuration of publishers, system listeners, and session actions has been moved to
		the systemListeners.xml, adminPlugins.xml, and sessionStartupActions.xml files which 
		can be found in the "system" folder within your configured pentaho solution directory.
	
		If you're looking for the objects node, this functionality
		has been moved to the file pentahoObjects.spring.xml in the
		system solution.
		
		When everything is completed, this file will go away, and
		not be at all required by the bi-platform-engine classes.
		Rather, the wiring of the components/engines/system will
		be able to be implemented by many different wiring schemes.
		As a bare minimum, we'll have examples of system wiring using
			Spring injection
			Hand coded wiring
			properties-file wiring
		
		This new system will allow for optimized wiring without requiring
		the PentahoSystem, SystemSettings, or any components to parse
		or interpret an XML document.
